Concern with growth and body size relations is well-founded, especially given the decline of the state of the Earth's biosphere. Given this decline, never has it been so crucial for ecologists to make prudent, accurate predictions about what will happen to life on Earth and prioritise what life to conserve as resources become increasingly stretched and time is of the essence. Ontogenetic growth gives rise to different, ecologically-distinct stages across the lifetime of an organism. Knowledge and powerful theory which allows us to ascertain which stages are most crucial to an organism's conservation, such as ontogenetic growth models and (st)age-based models will allow us to direct resources to conserving not only organisms themselves, but the stages of ontogeny within those organisms which are most crucial to the species' survival.

Larger organisms have lower mass-specific metabolic rates i.e. demand less energy per unit body mass, tend to live for longer and sleep for longer than smaller organisms. They have lower intrinsic rates of increase and population sizes and slower rates of evolution. 

\subsubsection{A glitch in the matrix}

        The biological literature suggests that both branches typically assume that reproductive output scales isometrically with body size, e.g. a single 2kg female has the same reproductive output as two 1kg females. However, a recent meta-analysis of marine fishes covering 342 species and 15 orders has contradicted this assumption, with larger mothers reproducing disproportionately more for 95\% of species, i.e. reproductive hyperallometry whereby a single 2kg female reproduces more than two 1kg females \autocite{Barneche2018d}. It has since been argued that reproductive hyperallometry profoundly challenges mechanistic theories of growth, which should be revised accordingly, and that this hyperallometry drives growth trajectories in ways largely unanticipated by current theories PLAG \autocite{Marshall2019b}. In their opinion paper, \cite{Marshall2019b} correctly proclaim that these recent results beg two questions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item How reasonable is an assumption of isometric reproductive output (isometric reproductive scaling)?
            \item If reproduction is not isometric, how does this alter our understanding of growth?
        \end{enumerate}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Why model at all? Brief Philosophy of modelling - Dustin's paper - Mechanistic and phenomenological
            \item Migration of Biology to theory as a discipline - use miniproject WU
            \item Why model growth? What's the point? 
            \item What can we gain from doing it successfully? 
            \item How long have scientists tried?
            \item What obstacles have they encountered?
            \item Detail the broad approaches - Top-down and bottom-up (Dustin's paper) - Examples of each - compare contrast
            \item Is it possible to reconcile the two?
            \item Why do the others fail to recover reproductive hyperallometry?
        \end{itemize}
        New plan
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Why model growth?
            \item What is the status quo regarding why growth stops? - go right back to the first model - who attempted it first? anabolisms vs catabolism
            \item challenges with modelling growth - what EXACTLY makes it difficult to capture mathematically?
            \item What's missing? Resource supply
            \item Reproduction? Well not really since reproduction can just be considered increasing $b$
            \item But not hyperallometric reproduction which was recently found. Claimed that it was hyperallometric but it was batch fecundity - not a continuous rate. Dig further into this with Dustin's paper
            \item We set out to see if fecundity really is hyperallometric mass scaling.
        \end{itemize}
