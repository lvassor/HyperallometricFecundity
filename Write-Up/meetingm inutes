food base of fish as fish - spiral effect
if we start hitting their prey we'll doubly screw them
why do we need to consider intake rate ^^ 
can they optimise both
understand that both are being 

for a constant pred:prey ratio, the smaller you are, the lower down you are on a food web, they escape a series of different predation predators
if you take out the larger individuals you then increase the survivorship of the small fish
small fish have different home ranges

pressure on small fish (predation) will come from larger fish - we select for small sizes.
simon jennings - size ratios 1-2 orders of mag

abstract
bracketed definition of hyperallometry (disproportionately more with size)
and makes predictions which people can test

add last centre: my model also makes further prediction about different environments. add a few more lines to discussion which i allude to in abstract - which empirical studies should estimate. what predictions
table with parameters from SU in methods

end of introduction "implications" can go in asbtract. end of intro: below i present a model effect
major caveat
