At $\alpha$, a reproduction term is introduced where c is the proportion of body mass allocated to reproduction and $\rho$ is the reproduction mass-scaling exponent:


Equally, models which do not explicitly consider reproduction at any point (only maintenance, $-bm$) make the same assumption implicitly, since modelling across ontogeny or lifespan assumes progression to maturity, which incurs an energetic cost, which must come from maintenance cost. This again assumes isometric mass-scaling of reproduction allocation rate. In the \cite{Marshall2019b} update to \cref{charnov}, they add a scaling exponent to $cm$ and make a philosophical argument for its superior accuracy by fitting this new model to fish age-at-size data, which fits as well as the \cite{West2001} and von \cite{vonBert1938} models (although they argue this by curve-overlap rather than using a valid model comparison metric such as Akaike or Baysian Information Criterion, which penalise additional parameters.) Crucially, however, this update is problematic in that it inadvertently reconciles two seemingly incompatible quantities. The fish hyperallometry data is not a rate, unlike the other elements of the model, intake rate and maintenance rate, which have dimensions \textsc{mass/time} (see SI for full derivation and dimensions). To this end, \cite{Marshall2019b} implicitly claim that these ``snapshots'' of fecundity for different sized fish of the same species together form a rate, which scales hyperallometrically. Here I seek to understand, theoretically, whether the scaling of a true instantaneous fecundity rate scales this way with mass. As stated, it is likely that this is only permitted under higher intake rate regime, resulting from steeper mass-scaling (see below).

These discrete measurements are not compatible with the continuous rates that growth models are built on (see SI), meaning, it is erroneous to simply add an extra non-linear term to \cref{west_ogm} to represent this new finding, since it is not a measure of allocation per unit time, but instead a snapshot of fecundity. In fact, if a model is made this way,
