Implicit in these models is the assumption that surplus energy is optimally allocated to growth \textit{after} non-negotiable maintenance of existing cells. This is derived from rearranging the conservation of energy equation presented by \cite{West2001}


DISCUSSION
\cite{West2001} addressed the issue of implied lifetime reproduction by estimating the premature, juvenile phase in fish to be short enough to be considered negligible, i.e. they effectively spend their entire life as a mature fish and, as such, their growth can be considered by their model. They also discuss the onset of reproduction and how it can be considered to be a higher maintenance cost based on energetic principles, since the energy density of egg and somatic cells are similar, thus maintenance term $b$ becomes $b + \lambda$ and asymptotic size reduces to $a/(b+\lambda)$ as the energy scope is reduced.


It is, therefore, futile to incorporate reproduction into growth models which consider intake, which is derived under an assumption of no reproduction. Even if reproduction were not a concern, organisms do not spend their life under these idealised conditions so using RMR is still wrong. Since growth rate is determined by the energy ``scope'' of the individual, it is crucial that these rates are accurate to field conditions in order to make accurate predictions of growth.

reproduction simply elevates maintenance cost. In some sense this is biologically correct, since development of the gonads at maturation means a fish is expending more joules of energy per second in maintaining this new tissue. (CAN WE ACTUALLY ACCOUNT FOR IT IN ANY OTHER WAY? WHAT REALLY IS c? ITS NOT A RATE LIKE A AND B, DEPENDS WHAT THEORY YOU'RE APPROACHING FROM)

However, this can lead to one of two new assumptions. 

If the the model is not biphasic, and is general across lifetime, implicitly it assumes that the allocation of energy to reproduction is spread across the ontogenetic lifetime of the individual, from birth to death ($t_0 \rightarrow t_{\infty}$), which has been argued to be true via allocation to the ``dissipative processes of maturation'' during the juvenile phase \autocite{Kearney2019}. \cite{West2001} discuss this and avoid this problem by estimating that the 

This deviation from $3/4$ scaling is likely due to the assumption of resting or basal metabolic rate measurements, of idealised idealised, often laboratory, conditions.
    
    Deviations from this scaling can arise because foraging is constrained by traits which do not scale with metabolic rate (e.g. locomotory appendages) and because metabolic rates are usually measured under . Those stipulated are no foraging (food is provided \textit{ad libitum}), growing or reproducing. These are not representative of a natural setting and, as such, consumption-rate may scale instead with field or maximal metabolic rate (exponent $\geq$ 0.85) \autocite{peters1983,Weibel2004, Pawar2012}. For 3-D foraging organisms, such as pelagic fish, exponent can reach 1.06, in a resorurce-depleted environment. By using the scaling of resting metabolic rate, models implicitly assume the idealised conditions of RMR measurements and may underestimate the intake rate given the lower mass exponent.
    


Unfinished/unformatted:
In fact, when I simulated this model numerically and examine the resulting growth curves, in a certain parameter space (depending on the age of maturtiy ($\alpha$) and reproduction ($c, \rho$)), I observed shrinking fish (see figure...). This results from the extra diversion of energy to gonads at the introduction of $- cm^\rho$ to the model. In these cases, when maturity is late and a large mass has been reached, since the loss terms are a function mass, the rate of growth $dm/dt < 0$, hence shrinking occurs. Whilst fish may chance size seasonally, over ontogeny fish do not grow to a large mass and then shed a substantial amount of weight to undergo reproduction. In the case of models which implicitly assume isometric reproduction averaged across lifetime, shrinking is not observed in simulations, as the cost of reproduction is implicitly assumed to begin from birth ($t_0$), resulting only a lower asymptotic size. It is my suspicion that several things could be occurring here
