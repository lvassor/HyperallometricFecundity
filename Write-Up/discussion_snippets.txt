Whilst these two branches of theory tend to operate in isolation, several attempts have been made at combining them. To reconcile the two theories, authors have typically derived seperate, energetically-governed growth equations for different ontogenetic stages, e.g. juvenile and mature, to form two-piece or ``biphasic'' models (reviewed in \cite{Wilson2018}) Post-maturity equations usually introduce a new energy loss term representing the rate of energy allocated to reproduction or gonad mass. These hybrids maximise explanatory potential by blending both philosophies to gain a proximate and ultimate understanding of growth \autocite{Marshall2019b}.    
most mechanistic modelsdespite being an uncontroversially fundamental life history event, d do not explicitly account for reproduction. , rendering inferences made from these models problematic \autocite{Day1997, Marshall2019b}. Reproduction incurs large energetic costs and increases mortality risk, with some highly fecund vertebrates consisting of 75\% reproductive tissue \autocite{Parker2018}. At the onset of reproduction, different energetic mechanistims emerge in contrast to the preceding juvenile phase as energetic resources are shunted from growth to reproduction \autocite{Day1997}. 
since the results of a large meta-study on fish growth were published, which concluded that total fish fecundity, considering clutch size, egg volume and egg energy content, scales hyperallometrically with mass \autocite{Barneche2018d}.

Ergo, the chain of causality in the scientific approaches of Metabolic Theory and Life History Theory are the inverse of one another. Life History Theory asks: ``given that these mechanisms exist and scale, what is the predicted optimum strategy?'' whereas Metabiolic Theory asks: ``given that these strategies have evolved to be optimal, what are the energetic mechanisms that explain them?''. 
In this respect, Determinate growers reach an asymptotic mass, when the individual is ``spending'' energy via metabolism as quickly as it can acquire it, thus leaving no surplus for growth.

Implicit in these models is the assumption that surplus energy is optimally allocated to growth \textit{after} non-negotiable maintenance of existing cells. This is derived from rearranging the conservation of energy equation presented by \cite{West2001}

To do so, mathematical biologists have constructed sophisticated mathematical models, using laws from quantitative disciplines, such as the laws of geometry and laws of thermodynamics \& enzyme kinetics, to accurately predict the value of size across ontogeny.

use ecological metabolic theory and the \cite{West2001} model, developed by \cite{Charnov2001}, as a framework to esimtate the true size of the mass-scaling exponent of reproduction allocation as a continuous energetic rate in fish mothers. Additionally, I use the consumption-rate findings of \cite{Pawar2012} and updated values of fish caloric equivalents to better inform energy intake values for the model. In doing so, I first map the biologically-feasible space of bivariate fecundity parameter values. Using this space I then optimise the parameters of the growth model to produce the highest amount of lifetime reproduction to answer the following questions: \textit{Q}1: \textit{Do prior frameworks prevent reproductive hyperallometry by underestimating the scaling of intake rate?}; \textit{Q}2: \textit{The continuous rate of allocation of energetic resources to reproduction scales allometrically with mass in fish mothers}; and 

DISCUSSION
\cite{West2001} addressed the issue of implied lifetime reproduction by estimating the premature, juvenile phase in fish to be short enough to be considered negligible, i.e. they effectively spend their entire life as a mature fish and, as such, their growth can be considered by their model. They also discuss the onset of reproduction and how it can be considered to be a higher maintenance cost based on energetic principles, since the energy density of egg and somatic cells are similar, thus maintenance term $b$ becomes $b + \lambda$ and asymptotic size reduces to $a/(b+\lambda)$ as the energy scope is reduced.


It is, therefore, futile to incorporate reproduction into growth models which consider intake, which is derived under an assumption of no reproduction. Even if reproduction were not a concern, organisms do not spend their life under these idealised conditions so using RMR is still wrong. Since growth rate is determined by the energy ``scope'' of the individual, it is crucial that these rates are accurate to field conditions in order to make accurate predictions of growth.

reproduction simply elevates maintenance cost. In some sense this is biologically correct, since development of the gonads at maturation means a fish is expending more joules of energy per second in maintaining this new tissue. (CAN WE ACTUALLY ACCOUNT FOR IT IN ANY OTHER WAY? WHAT REALLY IS c? ITS NOT A RATE LIKE A AND B, DEPENDS WHAT THEORY YOU'RE APPROACHING FROM)

However, this can lead to one of two new assumptions. 

If the the model is not biphasic, and is general across lifetime, implicitly it assumes that the allocation of energy to reproduction is spread across the ontogenetic lifetime of the individual, from birth to death ($t_0 \rightarrow t_{\infty}$), which has been argued to be true via allocation to the ``dissipative processes of maturation'' during the juvenile phase \autocite{Kearney2019}. \cite{West2001} discuss this and avoid this problem by estimating that the 

This deviation from $3/4$ scaling is likely due to the assumption of resting or basal metabolic rate measurements, of idealised idealised, often laboratory, conditions.
    
    Deviations from this scaling can arise because foraging is constrained by traits which do not scale with metabolic rate (e.g. locomotory appendages) and because metabolic rates are usually measured under . Those stipulated are no foraging (food is provided \textit{ad libitum}), growing or reproducing. These are not representative of a natural setting and, as such, consumption-rate may scale instead with field or maximal metabolic rate (exponent $\geq$ 0.85) \autocite{peters1983,Weibel2004, Pawar2012}. For 3-D foraging organisms, such as pelagic fish, exponent can reach 1.06, in a resorurce-depleted environment. By using the scaling of resting metabolic rate, models implicitly assume the idealised conditions of RMR measurements and may underestimate the intake rate given the lower mass exponent.
    


Unfinished/unformatted:
In fact, when I simulated this model numerically and examine the resulting growth curves, in a certain parameter space (depending on the age of maturtiy ($\alpha$) and reproduction ($c, \rho$)), I observed shrinking fish (see figure...). This results from the extra diversion of energy to gonads at the introduction of $- cm^\rho$ to the model. In these cases, when maturity is late and a large mass has been reached, since the loss terms are a function mass, the rate of growth $dm/dt < 0$, hence shrinking occurs. Whilst fish may chance size seasonally, over ontogeny fish do not grow to a large mass and then shed a substantial amount of weight to undergo reproduction. In the case of models which implicitly assume isometric reproduction averaged across lifetime, shrinking is not observed in simulations, as the cost of reproduction is implicitly assumed to begin from birth ($t_0$), resulting only a lower asymptotic size. It is my suspicion that several things could be occurring here
