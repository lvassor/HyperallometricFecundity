# Hourglass structure

* Why model at all? Brief Philosophy of modelling - Dustin's paper - Mechanistic and phenomenological
* Migration of Biology to theory as a discipline - use miniproject WU
* Why model growth? What's the point? 
* What can we gain from doing it successfully? 
* How long have scientists tried?
* What obstacles have they encountered?
* Detail the broad approaches - Top-down and bottom-up (Dustin's paper) - Examples of each - compare contrast
* Is it possible to reconcile the two?
* Why do the others fail to recover reproductive hyperallometry?

## New plan

* Why model growth?
* What is the status quo regarding why growth stops? - go right back to the first model - who attempted it first? anabolisms vs catabolism
* challenges with modelling growth - what EXACTLY makes it difficult to capture mathematically?
* What's missing? Resource supply
* Reproduction? Well not really since reproduction can just be considered increasing $b$
* But not hyperallometric reproduction which was recently found. Claimed that it was hyperallometric but it was batch fecundity - not a continuous rate. Dig further into this with Dustin's paper
* We set out to see if fecundity really is hyperallometric mass scaling.
