The recent migration of biology towards that of a theoretical discipline has seen mathematical biologists attempt to capture growth in the form of sophisticated mathematical models. In a rapidly changing world, scientific theory will allow us to pierce through the noise in the data we collect and reduce the uncertainty in how the world is constructed and functions. The way in which we do this, traditionally, is to utilise human knowledge to eliminate improbable links from all logical possibilites and suggest the probable value or range of values for a dependent variable. The tools permitting this being quantifiable, mathematisable, testable ideas which are derived from underlying generic principles and built into a predictive framework, called a scientific theory \autocite{peters1983, West2011}. ADD POPPER 1967 and 1972. In order to accurately predict and understand biological phenomena, biology is undergoing a transition towards a discipline whose predictive power is increasingly derived from  biological theory. Mathematical biologists and physicists are now using laws from quantitative disciplines to accurately predict the value of dependent variables, such as laws of geometry \& scaling and laws of thermodynamics \& enzyme kinetics.
