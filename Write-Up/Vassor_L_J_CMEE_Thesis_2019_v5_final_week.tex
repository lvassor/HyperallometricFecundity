%%% Abstract %%%
\section*{Abstract}\thispagestyle{plain}
    The amount of metabolic energy an organism can sequester from its environment fundamentally determines its scope for growth and reproduction. Here I use an energetics and life history theoretical model to estimate the optimum mass-proportion and mass-scaling values of fecundity rate in fish, under different energy intake regimes, to test a recent claim that it scales hyperallometrically with mass. Theoretically, I show that a truly continuous rate of allocation to fecundity cannot scale hyperallometrically with size. I also derive and validate the use of a new intake rate value, based on fish energetics data and field metabolic rate mass-scaling, by demonstrating that the onset of reproductive allocation at maturity is only possible given these intake rate values. Overall, the study highlights the importance of correctly characterising growth and the fitness contribution of different sized individuals to a population.

\section{Introduction}\thispagestyle{plain}
    Organisms must grow by synthesising biomass from consumed resources in order to progress through ontogeny, or stages of life. The rate of biomass production directly influences fitness at the individual level by constraining the speed at which maturity is reached. Beyond the individual, growth has scalable, measurable impacts at multiple ecological levels, by constraining food-web trophic structure and energy transfer efficiency \autocite{Barneche2018}. Biologists have sought to gain a proximate and ultimate understanding ontogenetic growth for over a century. \textit{Why do organisms grow at a specific rate during a specific stage? Why do they stop growing? What causes this? Can growth be controlled, and if so, why? What is the optimal size to grow to? When is the optimal age to mature?} These are all valid and relevant questions, answers to which require a theoretical understanding of the energetics of growth and how evolution has selected for the patterns we observe given these constraints. 
    
    Energetic constraints dictate the variety of sizes and, consequently, the fantastic spectrum of niches resident in the biosphere since most key physiological, ecological and life history traits covary with body size \autocite{peters1983, brown2000-scaling-book,schmidt1984scaling,Marshall2019b}. To quote \cite{Bartholomew1981} ``It is only a slight overestimate to say that the most important attribute of an animal, both physiologically and ecologically, is its size''. As such, growth modelling has historically been a popular endeavor in the biological sciences, demanding a knowledge of the mechanisms which shape resource allocation and evolutionary strategy. This prerequisit has attracted theorists, field ecologists and applied scientists, in a joint endeavor to translate growth as a quantifiable, mathematisable and testable idea into a theoretical, predictive framework \autocite{popper1962,popper1972,peters1983, West2011}. Geometric scaling laws are especially relevant to this pursuit since many biological traits scale with body size, governed by a power law: $Y = Y_0 M^{\beta}$, where $Y$ is the trait to be predicted, $M$ is body mass, and $Y_0$ and $\beta$ are empirically-derived constants. These laws have been formalised into ``allometric" equations. If $\beta = 1$, the scaling is said to be ``isometric", while if $\beta \neq 1$, the relationship is called allometric, and plots as a curve on linear axes \autocite{brown2000-scaling-book}.

    Historically, the approaches used to model ontogenetic growth bifurcate into two major branches. Evolutionary Life History Theory, which relates growth, phenomenologically, to the optimum timing of fundamental life history events, and Ecological Metabolic Theory, which relates growth, mechanistically, to fundamental cellular and energetic processes which constrain the scope for growth.
        
    Evolutionary life history theorists have typically employed optimisation techniques to solve for the age and size values of given life history events which maximise fitness, e.g. age-at-maturation. The \textit{modus operandi} is to assume that evolution selects for timing and growth strategies which do this by optimising trade-offs among competing traits \autocite{Day1997, Stearns1989, stearns1992evolution}. Typically, then, simplifying assumptions are made with regard to energetic mechanisms \autocite{Day1997, Kozowski1987-indeterminate}, which are view as the end evolutionary result of selection on body size, an exemplar of a ``top-down'' approach.
        
    Converseley, metabolic theorists utilise laws from thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics as a first-principles approach to growth problems, starting with energetics and ending with body size, i.e. a ``bottom-up'' approach \autocite{Brown2004}. Paradigmatically, lifetime growth is governed by the distribution and transformation of available energy. These bioenergetic growth models are predicated on the premise that growth is constrained by an energy scope or profit. An organism garners energy from its environment at a certain rate (revenue), some of which it expends on internal maintenance (metabolism) at a certain rate (cost). Any surplus energy remaining after this expenditure, can then be used to synthesise new biomass for growth \autocite{Holdway1984, Rochet2001}. Growth slows because maintenance rate scales with mass to a larger exponent than intake rate (different power laws), so this energy profit decreases with size. Extant models agree upon a mass exponent of 1 for maintenance rate (double the body mass = double the number of cells), whereas the mass exponent of intake rate has been debated through time, given its derivation from different geometric mechanisms. Early models suggested a value of $2/3$ \autocite{Putter1920,vonBert1938, VonBertalanffy1957}, due to intake being governed by absorbtion across a membrane surface (rearrangement of $\pi r^2$). However, recent models tend to use a value of $3/4$, proposed by \cite{West1997}, instead due to energy transport begin governed by a fractal-like supply network (e.g. capillaries), the result being their ``general ontogenetic growth model'' (see \cref{west_ogm}).
    
    Since power laws have the convenient property of the exponent being equal to the slope after a logarithmic transformation, $\log{(am^y)} = y\cdot \log{(am)}$, these scalings can be understood more intuitively when plotted (\cref{growth_schedules}).

        \end{minipage}%
    \end{center}
    Intriguingly, review of the modelling literature highlights two distinct gaps present in most mechanistic models: the assumed scaling laws for resource intake rate and for fecundity rate.
    
    Resource intake rate scaling has previously been shown to exhibit environment and dimensionality-dependence, which most extant models ignore \autocite{Pawar2012}. Many assume a simple relationship between energy intake rate and resting metabolic rate, such that per-capita resource supply scales with consumer body size ($m$) to an exponent of $3/4$ (see above), irrespective of taxon or environment \autocite{Pawar2012}. Environment and dimension-dependence means that consumption rate can, in fact, scale to an exponent as large as $1.06$ and as low as $0.85$, the latter being the approximate value of the mass-scaling exponent of field metabolic rate \autocite{peters1983,Weibel2004, Pawar2012}. Since fish, or any wild population, experience field conditions throughout life, it may, in fact, be more prudent to assume a relationship between intake rate and field metabolic rate, rather than resting \autocite{Boisclair1993}.

    Fecundity rate, or the continuous allocation of resources to reproduction, was recently claimed to scale hyperallometrically with mass in fish WRONG THEY DON'T CLAIM RATE. That is, larger mothers are disproportionately more fecund \autocite{Barneche2018d}. Consequently, explicit account of reproduction in ontogenetic growth models received great attention in a review of the modelling literature\autocite{Marshall2019b}. The conclusion was that these results reset theoretical assumptions of growth models, with profound fisheries implications, given that quotas are estimated using spawning potential metrics calculated from these types of model. However, such a claim may be premature in its making, since the data analysed by \cite{Barneche2018d} represent batch fecundity at discrete time points, a consequence of the typical sampling technique used to measure gonad properties, involving catch and dissection. These discrete measurements are not compatible with the continuous rates that growth models are built on (see SI), meaning, it is erroneous to simply add an extra non-linear term to \cref{west_ogm} to represent this new finding, since it is not a measure of allocation per unit time, but instead a snapshot of fecundity. In fact, if a model is made this way, when simulated, shrinking growth trajectories are produced, as the loss of energy to maintenance of cells plus this new term cannot be compensated for by resource intake. Since fish do not shed somatic mass over ontogeny, shrinking may be indicative of false approximation of the scaling to fecundity rate.

    Both of these findings reveal disconnects in the ontogenetic growth modelling literature which I address here. In this paper, I show that allocation to fecundity, as an instantaneous rate, is theoretically unlikely to exhibit hyperallometric mass-scaling in fish mothers, under the traditional intake rate scaling regime which uses the canonical $3/4$ exponent. When I increase this exponent, causing intake rate to scale steeper, I then show that reproductive hyperallometry can emerge, due to the compensation effect of the larger intake rate.
    
    These theoretical findings will be crucial in generating new hypotheses for testing empirical data and for highlighting the distinction between continuous rate data and discrete time data. Further, these findings likely warrant update of how existing models consider intake rate, since the reason we do not observe shrinking trajectories in reality may be because larger intake rate scaling permits larger (hyperallometric) scaling exponents of fecundity. They will also be in creating space for new theory to develop in understanding the energetic mechanisms behind fecundity rate allocation. Finally, bridging these questions will  Quantifying the effects of these new findings for fish growth models will have profound implications for fisheries management and for growth modelling as a scientific practice in general.

\subsection{Theory and Questions}

The \cite{West2001} general model is derived from an organism of wet mass $m$ (g), a resting metabolic rate $b$ ($J \cdot d^{-1}$) and a growth rate per unit time of $dm/dt$ ($g \cdot d^{-1}$),
\begin{align}
    \frac{dm}{dt} &= am^{3/4} - bm \label{west_ogm}
\end{align}
where $a \equiv B_{0}m_{c}/E_{c}$ and $b \equiv B_{c}/E_{c}$. $B_0$ is a metabolic normalisation constant invariant within a taxon, $m_{c}$ is the mass of a single cell, $E_{c}$ is the energy expended to synthesise a single cell ($J \cdot g^{-1}$) and $B_{c}$ is the metabolic rate of a single cell. $x$ and $y$ are dimensionless mass-scaling exponents which are assumed to take values of $3/4$ and $1$, respectively. The $3/4$ scaling of intake rate is set by the resting metabolic rate, which scales to the $3/4$ exponent of mass \autocite{Kleiber1947, peters1983, niklas1994plant} due to the approximate fractal architecture of supply networks which become more deeply nested with branches as body size increases \autocite{West1997}. This geometry has evolved due to natural selection optimising energy transport to the cells and consequently, as size increases, the number of terminal units (capillaries) scales to the $3/4$ exponent of mass \autocite{West1997, West2005}. As fractals are mathematically considered to have non-integer dimensions \autocite{Hausdorff1918, Mandelbrot1982}, this gives rise to non-integer size-scaling. The isometric scaling of maintenance ($y = 1$) is set by the linear increase in cells with mass, i.e. if an organism's mass $= m$, then a size $2m$ organism has twice the cells to maintain.

In order to address the lacking fecundity rate term in this model, \cite{Charnov2001} developed the framework to include a term to represent fecundity allocation rate, in order to solve for optimum life history values. Until maturity (age $\alpha$, size $m_{\alpha}$), fish incur costs only from maintenance as they are sexually immature, captured by \cref{west_ogm}. At $\alpha$, a reproduction term is introduced where c is the proportion of body mass allocated to reproduction and $\rho$ is the reproduction mass-scaling exponent. Crucially, \cite{Charnov2001} assumed that fecundity rate scales isometrically with size, which is mathematically equivalent to elevating maintenance cost, since the maintenance and reproduction term have equivalent mass-scaling exponents:
\begin{align}
    \frac{dm}{dt} &= am^{3/4} - bm - cm \nonumber \\
    \frac{dm}{dt} &= am^{3/4} - (b+c)m \label{charnov}
\end{align}
Equally, models which do not explicitly consider reproduction at any point (only maintenance, $-bm$) make the same assumption implicitly, since modelling across ontogeny or lifespan assumes progression to maturity, which incurs an energetic cost, which must come from maintenance cost. This again assumes isometric mass-scaling of reproduction allocation rate.

I investigated the parameterisation of \cref{west_ogm} which revealed a flaw in the intake rate values used by \cite{West2001} and \cite{Charnov2001} models is the intake rate coefficient, $a$ (see \cref{west_ogm}). In order to theoretically endorse their model fit results for the value of $a$, \cite{West2001} used fundamental cellular properties to derive an approximate value of $a$ (See SI for full derivation). Bioenergetically, $a$ represents the number of cells grown per unit time given the energy available ($\frac{\textsc{mass}}{\textsc{joules}} \cdot \frac{\textsc{joules}}{\textsc{sec}}$). They claim their theoretical calculation of $a$ is in ``good agreement'' with the model fit estimate for $a$ in their Table 1, but brief observation reveals that this claim only holds true for mammals, not birds and fish (fish are an order of magnitude lower), an intuitive deduction since they used the energy content of mammalian tissue in their calculation, taken from \cite{peters1983}. However, further investigation makes apparent the intriguing value they use for $B_0$. This quantity remains constant within a taxon, and \cite{West2001} chose the value known for unicellular organisms, derived from data published by \cite{Hemmingsen1960}, collected by \cite{peters1983}, which included different slope (scaling) values for unicellulars, poikilotherms and homeotherms. Given the deliberate choice to use a caloric equivalent value for mammals only, it is perplexing that they chose to ignore the $B_0$ value for homeotherms.

Given my aim to model growth and life history in fish, this choice is not only of particular interest but is crucial given that this endeavour mandates accurate values for fixed parameters, such as $a$, in order for optimised free parameters to be biologically realistic. To this end, I altered their calculation of $a$ to include values for the same cellular parameters but which are accurate to fish. Tissue energy content $E_T$ for fish was calculated as the average from caloric equivalents across 70 fish species (see SI) \autocite{Cummins1971, Steimle1980, Hartman1995}, converted from $kJ\cdot g^{-1}$ to $JKg^{-1}$ using ``per gram of wet weight'' values, the same metric used by \cite{West2001}. Repeating the same calculation: $E_T$ is the energy content of fish tissue $= 5.63 \cdot 10^3 J\cdot g^{-1}$ and $m_c$ is the mass of a single cell $\approx 3 \cdot 10^{-9} \textsc{g}$, thus $E_c$, the energy required to create a cell \textit{in viro} = $1.69 \cdot 10^{-5} J$. $B_0 \approx 1.4 \cdot 10^{-1} W$ for poikilotherms. By substitution:
\begin{align*}
    a &\equiv \frac{B_{0}m_{c}}{E_{c}} \\
    a &= \frac{(1.4 \cdot 10^{-1} W)(3 \cdot 10^{-9} g)}{1.69 \cdot 10^{-5} J}\\
    a &= 2.4867 \cdot 10^{-5}g\cdot s^{-1} \\
    2.4867 \cdot 10^{-5}&g\cdot s^{-1} \cdot 24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60 \ \ \textsc{   seconds to days}\\
    a &= 2.1485 g^{1/4}\cdot day^{-1}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Can instantaneous fecundity rate scale hyperallometrically with mass in fish mothers?}
\cite{Barneche2018d} show that fecundity output in fish scales hyperallometrically with body size and consequently, in a recent review of growth models, \cite{Marshall2019b} took particular issue with an assumption that most mechanistic models are supposedly guilty of. Specifically, that fecundity rate scales isometrically with mass. They update \cref{charnov} by adding a scaling exponent to the fecundity rate term $cm^{\rho}$ and take a philosophical stand by fitting this model to fish age-at-size data, which fits as well as the \cite{West2001} and von \cite{vonBert1938} models (although they argue this by curve-overlap rather than using a valid model comparison metric such as Akaike or Baysian Information Criterion, which penalise additional parameters.) However, upon deriving the units present in this equation, it becomes apparent that the \cite{Marshall2019b} model is problematic in that it inadvertently reconciles two incompatible quantities. The other elements of the model, intake rate and maintenance rate, are both instantaneous rates, whose units are \textsc{mass/time} in continuous time (see SI for full derivation and unit explanation). However, the fecundity data reported by \cite{Barneche2018d} were for discrete, batch spawning events, where the typical method of data collection is to catch and dissect a fish and take gonadal measurements at that point in time (Barneche, 2019, pers comm). To this end, \cite{Marshall2019b} implicitly claim that these ``snapshots'' of fecundity for different sized fish of the same species together form a rate. 

To test whether hyperallometry is possible for an instantaneous rate of fecundity allocation, I usied a biphasic, hybrid model which utilises Ecological Metabolic Theory and Life History Theory by capturing the energetics of growth during two distinct ontogenetic stages. Mature fish experience continuous diversion of resources to fecundity which scales to the $\rho$ exponent of mass.
\begin{align}
    \frac{dm}{dt} &= am^{3/4} - bm \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ m < m_{\alpha} \label{luke_model_juvenile}\\
    \frac{dm}{dt} &= am^{3/4} - bm - cm^{\rho} \ \ \ \ \ m \geq m_{\alpha} \label{luke_model}
\end{align}

The model is based on the Life History Theory concept that assumes that natural selection optimises strategies, e.g. $c$ and $\rho$, to maximise fitness, where lifetime reproductive output can be used as a proxy for fitness, denoted $R_0$, which can be derived from theoretical evolution studies \autocite{Charnov2001, stearns1992evolution}. To this end, I tested the model via simulations which allowed the fecundity rate parameters $c$ and $\rho$ to vary in order to maximise $R_0$, which is calculated using a life history model, developed from \cite{Charnov2001}. Since the scope for reproduction is determined by how much energy is available, it follows that the optimal values of $c$ and $\rho$ are dependent on the value and scaling of intake rate $am^{x}$, addressed in \textit{H3}. 

At any time $t$, $b_{t}$ is the \textit{effective} energy allocated by fish to reproduction, the product of the physiological allocation of resources $cm^{\rho}$ and an efficiency term $h(m)$ representing a declining efficiency of this allocation, known as reproductive senescence, the natural decline in fecundity as fish age \autocite{Stearns2000, Benoit2018, Vrtilek2018}. This decline begins at maturity ($\alpha$) and is controlled by a variable rate parameter $\kappa$. Fish also experience an extrinsic mortality rate, or actuarial senescence, contained in a surivorship function, $l_t$, which is effectively a declining $\mathbb{P}$(survival to $t$) \autocite{Beverton1959, Peterson1984, Charnov1993,Walters1993, Charnov2001, Benoit2018, Laird2010, Reznick2002, Reznick2006}. To the best of my knowledge, this study is the first intance of this incorporation of reproductive senescence into a growth and life history model. It is important to note than reproductive and acturarial senescence are functions of time or age, whilst allocation to reproduction is a function of mass. Thus, the instanteous reproductive output at time $t$ is the product $l_{t}b_{t}$ and the lifetime (cumulative) reproductive output is:
\begin{equation}
    R_{0} = \int_{\alpha}^{\infty}l_{t}b_{t} dt
\end{equation}
Since fish live in a juvenile and adult phase, they are subject to varying mortality rates through ontogeny \autocite{Charnov2001}. Juvenile mortality ($t_0 \rightarrow t_{\alpha}$) controls how many fish are alive at $\alpha$ and recruited into the adult phase. Since it follows an exponential distribution, $l_t = e^{-Z(t)}$ bounded [0,1], it acts as a scaling factor, denoted $L_{\alpha}$, for the mature population ($t_{\alpha} \rightarrow t_{\infty}$), which controls how many individuals are reach maturity \autocite{Charnov1990-agematurity}. For adults survival is relative to when maturity is reached, $l_{t} = e^{-Z(t-\alpha)}$. Therefore the lifetime survivorship of fish is the product of the juvenile survivosrhip, $L_{\alpha}$ and adult survivorhsip.
\begin{equation}
    R_{0} = c\int_{0}^{\alpha}e^{-Z(t)}dt\int_{\alpha}^{\infty} m(t)^{\rho} e^{-(\kappa+Z)(t-\alpha)} dt \label{LHT_optimisation}
\end{equation}
A common utility in comparative life histories in fish is the invariance of dimensionless quantities derived from the timing of life history events. That is, across species but within a taxon, certain life history variables, representing the timing and magnitude of reproduction form, dimensionless, invariant ratios \autocite{Charnov1990-invariant, Charnov1993}. It has been shown for fish that the ratio of age-at-maturity and mortality rate, $\alpha\cdot Z \approx 2$ \autocite{Charnov1993}. Logically, this invariant makes sense since delaying maturation ($\alpha \approx 2/Z$) is only a feasible strategy if the risk of dying is low enough, or increases less quickly. Rearranging this for $Z$ estimates mortality rate for a given $\alpha$ value $Z = 2/\alpha$.
See SI for full derivation of \cref{LHT_optimisation}.

Maximising $R_0$ requires analytically solving \cref{LHT_optimisation} for values of $c$ and $\rho$ which do so. Since \cref{LHT_optimisation} has no closed-form solution, I simulated this numerically using the \texttt{DifferentialEquations} and \texttt{DiffEqCallbacks} packages in Julia v1.1.1 \autocite{Bezanson2017}, which ran the Rosenbrock optimisation function \autocite{Rosenbrock1960}. The following parameter space was simulated: $0.001 < c < 0.4$ and $0.001 < \rho < 1.25$ \textcolor{red}{justification for these ranges} with 100 linearly-spaced values over a lifespan of $1e6$ days, to ensure all growth trajectory simulations reached asymptotic size (\textcolor{red}{LV Note: but fish don't reach their asymptotic size? Isn't this unrealistic?}). I produced a heatmap of the fecundity rate parameter space, with an optimum $c, \rho$ combination, for a fixed intake rate mass-scaling ($x$) and reproductive senescence rate ($\kappa$). Since the evolutionary goal is to maximise lifetime reproductive output, natural selection in fish will inevitably tend towards these optima across time, and thus optimum value combinations theoretically estimate if hyperallometrically scaled fecundity rate is possible.

\subsection{Is fecundity rate hyperallometry more likely when intake rate mass-scaling is steeper?}
Given the restrictive assumptions underlying resting metabolic rate of no foraging (food is provided \textit{ad libitum}), growing or reproducing, it seems far more prudent to relate intake rate to the mass-scaling of field metabolic rate, which may explain the deviation of consumption rate for $3/4$ scaling. This is especially so for the last two assumptions, which are both violated, since the fundamental purpose of this exercise is to capture growth and the model includes reproduction. Since it is likely that intake rate scales with field metabolic rate, as it is an active (as opposed to resting) metabolic activity, model optimisation was run for intake rate mass exponents $\geq 3/4$. Note that, mathematically, a small alteration to an exponent like this can drastically alter the behaviour of such a model, given that when $m > 1 g$, the exponent will dominate any changes in the coefficient. In order for fish to continue growing after maturity, it is necessary for intake rate to compensateEssentially, what I tested for here was whether the non-linearity of intake rate (gain) could compensate for the non-linearity of fecundity rate (loss) by permitting a larger mass-scaling of the latter.





Since the model results in some growth curves which exhibit shrinking (i.e. loss of mass at maturity), when simulated, I first obtained the feasible parameter space of $c$ and $\rho$ values at my given $\alpha$, which did not produce shrinking (see SI for full method explanation). To test hypothesis \textit{H2}, I increased the scaling of intake rate with the updated, fixed $a$ coefficient, to see if the feasible fecundity-rate parameter space, as well as the optimum $c, \rho$ combination changed in response.

\section{Results and Discussion}\thispagestyle{plain}
Production of a fecundity-rate feasibility heatmap proved necessary to obtain growth curves which did not shrink, but instead experienced an inflection, where growth rate remained positive ($dm/dt > 0$) as energy is diverted to reproduction at age $\alpha$ (see \cref{growth_curve}).

        \captionof{figure}{Growth undergoes an inflection, as it approaches an asymptote, at maturity when $\alpha = 200$, as opposed to shrinking, which would be rejected by the optimisation algorithm since shrinking in fish is not biologically possible. At maturity, growth rate slows (inflection) due to the diversion of resource to fecundity, leaving less scope for growth. Simultaneously, lifetime reproduction (cumulative) increases to an asymptote, when this quantity is less and less likely to increase given the exponential decay of survivorship probability, $l_t$.}

\textbf{Hypothesis \textit{H}1} \\
The life history optimisation results show that, theoretically, the continuous rate of reproductive allocation in mature fish does exhibit an allometric scaling relationship with mass ($\rho \neq 1$), however, a \textit{hyperallometric} relationship is heavily constrained by $\alpha$. Results suggest that for older maturity ages, hyperallometry is not possible without some form of energy top-up. Instead, the scaling relationship is generally hypoallometric, ($\rho < 1$), with a surprisingly low optimum $\rho = 0.06$ when the intake scaling exponent $x = 0.75$. Evidently, the canonical $3/4$ scaling of intake rate restricts and minimises the fecundity rate parameter space and values themselves when shrinking curves are omitted. This is due to the fact that $3/4$ mass-scaling of intake rate is not large enough to overcome even small values of $\rho$, which dominates the fecundity rate term, and additively forms a large loss term with maintenance cost, causing $dm/dt < 0$. The result for $c$ suggests that the theoretical optimum is to devote 17\% of body mass to fecundity per day, which conforms to the existing literature, which suggest 10-25\%. Results also appear unaffected by a changing $\kappa$, suggeting that the decline in fecundity is not does not occur at a large enough magnitude to overcome the investment in reproduction itself.

\textbf{Hypothesis \textit{H}2} \\
Increasing the value of the intake rate scaling exponent evidently permits larger values for the fecundity rate coefficient and scaling exponents by translating the curved parameter space upwards in the $\rho$ plane. An intuitive result, since $x$ now scales steeply enough to overcome larger fecundity rate parameters, i.e. compensate for the loss of energy that \textit{would} cause shrinking. \Crefrange{0.85, 0.01}{0.85, 0.1} reveal an intrinsic property of the fecundity rate parameter space, that its shape remains constant across the different intake rate allometries. Specifically, the range of feasible $c$ values is larger than the range of feasible $\rho$ values. This, again, makes mathematical sense due to different behaviours of a scalar ($c$) versus an exponent $\rho$, the latter dominating the term, hence having a narrow range of smaller feasible values. When $x$ is increased to 0.85, the optimum $\rho = 0.63$, substantially greater than at $x = 0.75$.

These results highlight a caveat of the model, which is that the fixed parameter $\alpha$ has a fundamental effect on the feasible parameter space. The aforementioned $\alpha Z$ invariant does, of course, cause the life history model (\cref{LHT_optimisation}) to behave the same regardless of the chosen $\alpha$, since $Z$ compensates. However, this invariant does not discipline the growth model (\cref{luke_model}), which is where predictive power begins to be lost. The results presented reflect $\alpha = 200$, or a fish maturity age of 200 days. However, I predict that adjusting $\alpha$ will have profound effects on the optimum fecundity rate parameter values, due to their relatedness to mass. Suppose $\alpha$ is set at a larger value, e.g. 400 days. This means that for double the amount of time, our hypothetical fish is governed only by \cref{luke_model_juvenile}, which incurs less cost (no reproduction), thus in this time the fish can grow larger. At $\alpha$, when it matures, it has already reached a larger size, thus the reproduction term takes on a much larger value, especially due to $\rho$. This sudden and larger diversion of resources causes $dm/dt < 0$, or shrinking. This is, in fact, how the feasible parameter space in the model is calculated. Suppose, for a given $c, \rho$ combination, a fish is born mature, thus incurring a $cm^{\rho}$ cost for its whole lifespan, if this trajectory's $m_{\infty}$ is smaller than $m_{\alpha}$ when maturity is delayed (e.g. $\alpha = 200$), then this fish will always shrink under this model. When fish mature very early on ($\alpha \rightarrow 0$), they can never reach a size $m_{\alpha} > m_{\infty}$ because they incur these costs from birth. Thus, I predict that at larger values of $\alpha$, only very small values for $\rho$ are possible, if not at all, across a fixed intake rate. In the case that $\rho \approx 0$ and $c \rightarrow 0$, this indicates that reproducing at that age, at all, is not possible, unless another quantity changes, e.g. intake exponent increases. Alternatively, this would indicate that the architecture of the model itself is not realistic, in the sense that fish do not suddenly become mature in the timescale of a single day and incur an immediately large cost. Instead, they either allocate to fecundity from a very early age while remaining sexually immature, termed ``the dissipative processes of respiration''. Or, in reality, the timescale of the juvenile phase is almost negligible in contrast to the timescale of the lifetime, hence they are only governed by \cref{luke_model} \autocite{West2001}.
