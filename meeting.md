# Meeting 23/7/19
* table for parameter values
* could use diego's data - could actually show hypo - lxmx curve. scaling of peak * fecundity?
* decline in fecundity after that is - scaling of fecundity relate to LH curve - which * part of their LH are we looking at here? Model output
* peak fecundity curve is a function
* emerges as consequence of survivorship 

* master equation
* optimisation equation
* relate two together
* solved it by simultqneously doing numerical integration, and plugging back in

* check carefully for mistake by including mx in such a way - mx should be a curve which * peaks then declines
* fecundity curves with lx curve 
* dont worry about van's sol on the board
* how is optimisation going to be done
* survivorship curve dominates - 
* bounds on parameters in table
* conceptualise what we do/dont have data for - we know this doesnt do anything

* prioritise writing mathematical forumlation and dimensions
* master -> parameters -> dimensions
* scaling equations - no params needed
