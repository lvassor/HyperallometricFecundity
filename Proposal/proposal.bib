abstract = {The allocation of metabolic energy to growth fundamentally influences all levels of biological organisation. Here we use a first?principles theoretical model to characterise the energetics of fish growth at distinct ontogenetic stages and in distinct thermal regimes. Empirically, we show that the mass scaling of growth rates follows that of metabolic rate, and is somewhat steeper at earlier ontogenetic stages. We also demonstrate that the cost of growth, Em, varies substantially among fishes, and that it may increase with temperature, trophic level and level of activity. Theoretically, we show that Em is a primary determinant of the efficiency of energy transfer across trophic levels, and that energy is transferred more efficiently between trophic levels if the prey are young and sedentary. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of characterising the energetics of individual growth in order to understand constraints on the structure of food webs and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Trophic interactions govern biomass fluxes in ecosystems, and stability in food webs. Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 × 10(-14) kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer-resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer-resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim To test long-standing theory on the role of environmental conditions (both mean and predictability) in shaping global patterns in the egg sizes of marine fishes. Location Global (50° S to 50° N). Time period 1880 to 2015. Major taxa studied Marine fish. Methods We compiled the largest geo-located dataset of marine fish egg size (diameter) to date (n = 1,078 observations; 192 studies; 288 species; 242 localities). We decomposed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a time series into mean and predictability (seasonality and colour of environmental noise – i.e. how predictable the environment is between consecutive time steps), and used these as predictors of egg size in a Bayesian phylogenetic hierarchical model. We test four specific hypotheses based on the classic discussion by Rass (), as well as contemporary life-history theory, and the conceptual model of Winemiller and Rose (). Results Both environmental mean and predictability correlated with egg size. Our parsimonious model indicated that egg size decreases by c. 2.0-fold moving from 1 to 30 °C. Environments that were more seasonal with respect to temperature were associated with larger eggs. Increasing mean chlorophyll-a, from 0.1 to 1 mg/m3, was associated with a c. 1.3-fold decrease in egg size. Lower chlorophyll-a seasonality and reddened noise were also associated with larger egg sizes – aseasonal but more temporally autocorrelated resource regimes favoured larger eggs. Main conclusions Our findings support results from Rass () and some predictions from Winemiller and Rose (). The effects of environmental means and predictability on marine fish egg size are largely consistent with those observed in marine invertebrates with feeding larvae, suggesting that there are important commonalities in how ectotherm egg size responds to environmental change. Our results further suggest that anthropogenically mediated changes in the environment will have profound effects on the distribution of marine life histories.},

abstract = {Organisms vary widely in size, from microbes weighing 0.1 pg to trees weighing thousands of megagrams — a 1021-fold range similar to the difference in mass between an elephant and the Earth. Mass has a pervasive influence on biological processes, but the effect is usually non-proportional; for example, a tenfold increase in mass is typically accompanied by just a four- to sevenfold increase in metabolic rate. Understanding the cause of allometric scaling has been a long-standing problem in biology. Here, we examine the evolution of metabolic allometry in animals by linking microevolutionary processes to macroevolutionary patterns. We show that the genetic correlation between mass and metabolic rate is strong and positive in insects, birds and mammals. We then use these data to simulate the macroevolution of mass and metabolic rate, and show that the interspecific relationship between these traits in animals is consistent with evolution under persistent multivariate selection on mass and metabolic rate over long periods of time.},

Location: Tropical reefs around the globe, including 485 sites in 109 sub-provinces spread across 14 biogeographic provinces. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: 2,523 species of reef fish. Methods: We compiled a database encompassing 13,050 visual transects. We used hierarchical linear Bayesian models to investigate whether fish body size, reef area, isolation, temperature, and anthropogenic impacts correlate with reef-fish species richness at each spatial scale (i.e., sites, sub-provinces, provinces). Richness was estimated using coverage-based rarefaction. We also tested whether species packing (i.e., transect-level species richness/m 2) is correlated with province-level richness. Results: Body size had the strongest effect on species richness across all three spatial scales. Reef area and temperature were both positively correlated with richness at all},

abstract = {Temperature often affects maternal investment in offspring. Across and within species, mothers in colder environments generally produce larger offspring than mothers in warmer environments, but the underlying drivers of this relationship remain unresolved. We formally evaluated the ubiquity of the temperature–offspring size relationship and found strong support for a negative relationship across a wide variety of ectotherms. We then tested an explanation for this relationship that for- mally links life-history and metabolic theories. We estimated the costs of development across tem- peratures using a series of laboratory experiments on model organisms, and a meta-analysis across 72 species of ectotherms spanning five phyla. We found that both metabolic and develop- mental rates increase with temperature, but developmental rate is more temperature sensitive than metabolic rate, such that the overall costs of development decrease with temperature. Hence, within a species' natural temperature range, development at relatively cooler temperatures requires mothers to produce larger, better provisioned offspring.},

@article{White2019a,
abstract = {A recent meta-analysis of published data demonstrated that reproductive output increases disproportionately with size in fish [1]. Building on this observation, we hypothesised that growth slows as animals increase in size because of an increasing allocation of energy to reproduction , and we demonstrated that this hypothesis is plausible by fitting a simple model of energy allocation to growth, reproduction, and maintenance to weight-forage data for a selection of fish species [2]. The fit of our model to growth data was indistinguishable from that of the well-known models of P{\"{u}}tter [3], von Bertallanfy [4,5], and the ontogenetic growth model (OGM) proposed by West and colleagues [6,7]. However, these and other existing models of growth [e. g., dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory] [8,9] fail to predict hyperallometric reproduction , and we therefore suggested that this disconnect between theory and data requires the revision of existing theory [2]. Kearney [10] undertakes such a revision of DEB theory [8,9], and demonstrates that the handling of the reproduction buffer in DEB can be altered to achieve hyperallometric reproduction in two species , which emerges '. .. either due to the way seasonal reproductive output builds up between years in a species with large eggs and small clutch size (the tortoise), or through an increasing draw-down on reproductive buffer with ontogeny (the cod)' ([10], supplemental information). He then goes on to suggest that physical constraints offer a more parsimonious universal explanation for the similarity in growth curves among species than does the presence of a universally optimal allocation to growth and reproduction that is consistently favoured by natural selection (e.g., [11,12]). He proposes that explanations based on physical constraints should be sought before other explanations, just as others have argued for the primacy of mechanistic over phenomenological models (e.g., [13-15]). Although we applaud any effort to bring theory and data into alignment, we disagree that mechanistic models are always more valuable than phenomeno-logical models. Modelling approaches in ecology and evolution span a continuum of approaches from phenomenological to mechanistic [14-19]. Phenomenological models use a mathematical function that can be fitted to data to describe underlying biological processes [16,18]. Mecha-nistic models explicitly track the details of the component parts and processes of a biological system that are hypothesised to give rise to the data [15,16,18]. Mech-anistic models therefore have parameters that describe the processes that occur, without reference to data in any one specific case [15]. Phenomenological models can have substantial predictive power, unless a prediction outside of the current known set of parameters is required, in which case mechanistic models should be superior [20]. Mechanistic models are particularly powerful if sufficient information exists to make a priori estimates of parameters and thereby make predictions that are robust to the state of a system. Most models lie somewhere between the above definitions, incorporating parameters that are estimated by fitting mecha-nistic functions to empirical data. This latter approach is the one taken by Kear-ney [10], in which the data for hyperallo-metric scaling of reproductive output with body mass [1,2] are used to estimate that, in cod, the reproductive drawdown parameter increases with size. Kearney [10] provides no mechanistic justification for the increasing drawdown of the reproduction buffer, and the approach is therefore phenomenological. Similar approaches are taken in the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) [21], which includes a normalisation constant that is estimated from data. DEB and MTE are both grounded in first principles, but incompletely so; both models include parameters that must be estimated from data [22,23] and are, sensu strictu, phenomenological. The estimation of parameters from data provides a valuable means of testing mechanistic theories when such parameter estimates can be compared to independent measurements [15]. DEB theory includes the state variables of structure, reserve, maturity, and reproduction buffer [22], and Kearney [10] notes that much confusion in theories of growth relate to the inadequacy of body mass as a state variable. The state variables of DEB are not directly observable [24], however, and therefore their values estimated from model fits cannot be compared to empirically determined values. The fit of Kear-ney's [10] revision of DEB to growth data for cod means that hyperallometric reproduction can now be recovered. However, testing the mechanistic basis of this fit directly would require measurement of changes in the reproduction buffer during ontogeny, which cannot be done: the dissipative process of maturity maintenance cannot be separated from structure maintenance because both are part of standard metabolic rate [25], and state variables cannot be measured, only inferred from fits to data. State variables must therefore be observed indirectly with targeted experiments and evaluated on the basis of conformity with model-derived predictions (e.g., [24] for a discussion of tests to distinguish DEB and TREE 2488 No. of Pages 2},

Two major branches of theory (mechanistic and phenomenological) describe the dynamics of growth and explain variation in the size of organisms. Both theory branches usually assume that reproductive output scales proportionately with body size, in other words that reproductive output is isometric. A meta-analysis of hundreds of marine fishes contradicts this assumption, larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more in 95{\%} of species studied, and patterns in other taxa suggest that reproductive hyperallometry is widespread. We argue here that reproductive hyperallometry represents a profound challenge to mechanistic theories of growth in particular, and that they should be revised accordingly.

abstract = {Population ecology has classically focused on pairwise species interactions, hindering the description of general patterns and processes of population abundance at large spatial scales. Here we use the metabolic theory of ecology as a framework to formulate and test a model that yields predictions linking population density to the physiological constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolism, and the ecological constraints of trophic structure and species richness on energy partitioning among species. Our model was tested by applying Bayesian quantile regression to a comprehensive reef-fish community database, from which we extracted density data for 5609 populations spread across 49 sites around the world. Our results indicate that population density declines markedly with increases in community species richness and that, after accounting for richness, energetic constraints are manifested most strongly for the most abundant species, which generally are of small body size and occupy lower trophic groups. Overall, our findings suggest that, at the global scale, factors associated with community species richness are the major drivers of variation in population density. Given that populations of species-rich tropical systems exhibit markedly lower maximum densities, they may be particularly susceptible to stochastic extinction.},

@article{Dell2011,
abstract = {To understand the effects of temperature on biological systems, we compile, organize, and analyze a database of 1,072 thermal responses for microbes, plants, and animals. The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87{\%} are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 +/- 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV. However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle-stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 +/- 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.},
