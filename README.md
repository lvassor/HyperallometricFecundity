*Author: Luke Joseph Vassor*

This repository contains the source code, data and notes for Luke Vassor's M.Sc. thesis at **Imperial College London**.

<!-- ![cover image](./Other/code.jpg) -->

All code in this repository was written in and tested with `R` 3.xx and `Python` 3.5.2

## Directory structure & contents
All directories are formatted with the same subdirectory structure in a clean workflow, as follows:<br/>
`Code` Contains all scripts.<br/>
`Data` Houses the data which are read into the scripts in `Code`. <br/>
`Results` Any form of script output, including, but not limited to, comma-separated files and pdf plots. This directory is under `.gitignore` so as not to void git convention of maintaining repository sizes of less than `100 MB`.<br/>
`Other` Any files not directly related to running the project.<br/>
