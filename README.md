# Explicitly accounting for the superlinear scaling of reproductive allocation in Ontogenetic Growth Models (OGMs)
*Author: Luke Joseph Vassor*

This repository contains the source code, data and notes for Luke Vassor's M.Sc. thesis at **Imperial College London**.

<!-- ![cover image](./Other/code.jpg) -->

All code in this repository was written in and tested with `R` 3.xx and `Python` 3.5.2

## Directory structure & contents
All directories are formatted with the same subdirectory structure in a clean workflow, as follows:<br/>
`Code` Contains all scripts written that week, either as part of the general tasks or in submission of practicals.<br/>
`Data` Houses the data which are read into the scripts in `Code`. <br/>
`Results` Any form of script output, including, but not limited to, comma-separated files and pdf plots. This directory is under `.gitignore` so as not to void git convention of maintaining repository sizes of less than `100 MB`.<br/>
`Other` Any files not required for university submission. In `Sandbox` you will find test scripts for exploring functions/techniques and in `Notes` you wil find lecture note files.<br/>

## Practical Submission
Each week's learning was assessed via practical submission. Practicals also came with extra credit questions. You will be able to identify these submissions in the readme explanation of files in `Code`.

## License

This work is produced for submission in partial fulfilment of the M.Sc. Computational Methods in Ecology & Evolution at Imperial College London.

## For Contributors/Co-authors:

<!-- * Note that the old materials, written in LaTeX, are now in the `archived` directory. -->

* The `Results` directory will be populated only when scripts are run, but these are not version controlled (all files in this directory under `.gitignore`).
