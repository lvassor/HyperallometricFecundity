SIZE EVOLUTION AND RELATION TO DEMOGRAPHY
Damouth's law - relationship between size and abundance of organisms. Larger, have fewer individuals at carrying capacity - to do with resources they require.
Ian Hatten - production of systems show predictable scaling patters. 
0.75 keeps reappearing when considering size and demography. Intuition is reasonable - we've built up predictions around how demography should scale with size based on metabolism (resources it uses determined by metabolic rate and size and thus these effect its demography)
growth limited by rate at which you can produce new materials which is limited by your metabolic rate - capacity to make a new you
fixed amount of energy entering a system, populations scale to the -B, energy equivalence rule - population energy flux independent of mass organisms use same amount of energy at carrying capacity
