        \begin{itemize}
            \item Thus far, energy supply is treated as an implicit assumption in growth/fecundity models. Incorporate as an explicit assumption.
            \item What do we need to change in the West \& Brown model?
            \item Check forward citations of Chernov paper to see other models people have come up with.
            \item Problem of resource supply:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item governing equations
                    \item master equation energy balance
                \end{itemize}
            \item Useful to specify master equation in more meaningful way.
            \item Diego's results suggest lifehistory must be getting enough resource supply 
        \end{itemize}
