## Optimisation
* Target dataset could be $m_alpha$
* Or could be rho optimisation
* 1 = integral, steady state - life histories evened out
    * solve for r - growth fitness
* Implicitly needs redefining what LH need to be optimised
* lxmx = mortality*fecundity - resource supply not
* add in bucket shaped Z - use exponential decay with time
* Assume that very young and old ages have another mortality rate - so different trade-off scaling.
* Can do a sensitivity analysis
* Can use delta as a step function - i.e. hybrid function
* Once solved - can we potentially get data on age at maturation?
* It's easier to optimise exponent on cm term - keep energy intake fixed
    * optimise repro output
* scaling of Lt at any given age?
* At any given mass can numerically integrate reproductive output - cumulative integral from alpha to infinity
* Size-dependent fecundity equation
* scaling beyond age won't hold
* scaling equation fecundity - as function of mass - write-out optimisation parts

## Method
* We can use a piece-wise approach
* Development rate equation
* a priori alpha size - integrating twice
* Juveniles/adults have different foraging strategies
* This offers rationale (?) for two-piece (but West argues alpha is relatively so low that you can just use the second equation)
* alpha at different times (intake rate as alpha at this point)
* juvenile scaling != adult scaling
* optimise scaling given supply?
* go as far as we can analytically
