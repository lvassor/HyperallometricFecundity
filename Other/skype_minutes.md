* Troy Day's equation
* Mark Higson paper
* atlantic cod
* extract consumption rate for fish from Dimensionality paper
* John DeLong functional response
* Rationalise what we are assuming the intake rate scaling to be - not straightforward to us about the distribution of the WBE model
* At the data end we need to get it together
* detailed empirical analysis of intake rate and other key rates involved
* assimilation efficieny and its scaling - functional response stuff
* Dustin RA compiled data on fecundity frequency - quick rate 
* development of repro organs - a lot of connective tissue - hidden energy
* energetic equivalent of gonad tissue is it different to somatic?
1) total output
2) measure of time interval
* nail down intake rate scaling for fish only
* student analyse John Delong's new big data set
* intake rate stuff - strong argument for finishing off what we started. thorough meta-analysis for fish intake rate and accompanying rates
* age at maturity stuff
