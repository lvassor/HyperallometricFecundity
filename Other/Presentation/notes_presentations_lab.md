# Lab Presentations Feedback

## Others - General
### Hsi-Cheung
* Create better flow between pieces - lots of pieces right now
* back up claims quantitatively

### Emma
* Make plots easy for the reader - even parameters
* write out whole terms
* key for colours in plots - make sure everything is account for ANCE!!

### Francis
* crush down previous work - focus on YOUR study

## Mine
### PawarLab
* LHT slide too dense, increase whitespace
* use bold typeface
* scale figure 6+7
* one more future direction
* instantaneous vs snapshot
* LHT is tool for fitness - ditch background
* remove maintenance 1 exp

### Samraat's Comments
* simplify the starting message - be very succinct about current state of affairs
* no need to go through the perspectives /
* using that LH tool to figure out what is happening at the instantanteous timescale 
* translate lists into succinct points
* indeterminate growth - internal constraints prevent you growing infinitely
* viva 0.85 - field metabolic rate pegged to 0.85 - consumption rate. computational limitations for going higher. one could argue even argue the WBE model is delivery not consumption. doesnt mean you can deliver it. doesnt make sense to up it to 1.06 - available energy
* 0.85 could be upper limit of what we want to explore
* just a 0.1 increase shows big difference
* LHT - here's the equation, here are the pieces. one slide thing.
* y-axis figure 6 - if this comes up in viva remind them
* simplify explanation at the end
* figure  - bring it back to biphasic model for supporting explanation
* one final box with all the models
* elaborate with some more explanation - flesh out what data i need. figure of intake rate into three dimensions
* these predictions, these are the data i need
* predict that fecundity rate
* explain empirical basis and future empirical implications. nothing wrong with model except some assumptions
* clearer relationship between intake and fecundity exp

### Second round
* Remove intake rate slide
* clear questions that i tackled in dissertation
* get from log-log plot. changing slopes.
* repro not included - not clear on what the slope is. diego showed this...

* remove bullets on capture slide. combine both into one box
* item sep larger on bullets
* IR scales more steeply for at least two reasons

## My feedback

### Deraj
* "I believe"
* emphasise AICc for non-CMEE. ranking best model fit.
* thermal optima vs lag. 
* Difference between were not statistically significant

### Jacob
* i liked the proportional combined model with timings
* why would you think that gunshots are lower in red?
* how do you define morning, afternoon and night
* supervised - labelling for other areas could come earlier 

### Eva
* good: "never been done"
* why is S2 more accurate?
* turning rates make encounters more likely?
* "we" believe
* I predict that.. 

### Joe
* figure for heavy tailed?
* as we know, single scale for exponential?
* sum across what?
* psi acts as a weight
* "we" and "our"
* reverse-engineering lambda rate from data?
* AIC explanation
* AIC better with less parameters - exponential vs gamma
* analytical error
* dense text
