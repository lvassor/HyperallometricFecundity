# Data Science Job Advice
*Katie Hindson, ex-CMEE*

## Presentation structure
1. Question
2. Hypothesis
3. Notes

Slides WITH visualisations

## Possible QUestions
1. What do **you** think we do?
* Interpreting a problem
* Ask yourself what it is exactly that they solve
* ML only use features which explicitly explain outcome
* If problem requires clustering then they use ML
* Can easily use a lm to cluster. 
* Don't use ML for everything - it introduces non-linearity
2. What are some/one of your weaknesses?
* Give a weakness with a positive light (e.g. too caught up in details - still a good thing essentially) and **recover** it - i.e. "bur I always do x to make sure it doesn't ..."
3. Why do you want to leave academia? 
* No time-delay in impact. Very quick results.
* 
## CV Advice
1. For CMEE play the "big data" card - used lots messy biological data - requires wrangling, cleaning - this is a nice seqway into questions
* Mention use of big data for thesis
2. Problem -> Answer -> Why It's Important (COMMUNICATE THE VALUE OF YOUR PROJECT)

## Typical Stages
1. CV
2. HR/Recruiter Phone Interview - worth sending to hiring manager? Explicit experience? Why job? Strengths/weaknesses
3. Hiring manager interview - culture fit
4. Take home test
