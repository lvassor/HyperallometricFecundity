The last century has seen many biologists attempt to successfully capture growth through ontogeny in the form of sophisticated mathematical models. Mechanistic approaches in developing these models have yielded several venerable biological theories which describe growth across different taxa and both determinate and indeterminate growth schedules. These include bottom-up approaches utilising first priniciples such as Metabolic Theory and Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory and arguably more top-down approaches such as Evolutionary Life History Theory and Game Theory.  In the former, while the "master" growth equation remains undisputed as a theoretical foundation, we believe there to be a gap in the literature, specifically how energy supply, realised through resource consumption affects ontogenetic growth. To this end, can the dispersal of growth data around the existing models be explained by the differential scaling of resource consumption rates with body mass found in previous studies? In this meta-study we address this by substituting parameter values for consumption rate from a previous study into an existing growth model and vary the allometric scaling exponent of consumption rate with size to observe the effects on asymptotic size in determinate growth schedules. Further, we investigate the implications of the hyperallometry of consumption rate mass scaling on the scaling of allocation of energy/mass to reproduction, which was found to scale superlinearly in recent literature. That is, larger mothers are disproportionately more fecund.
