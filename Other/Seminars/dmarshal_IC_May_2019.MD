### SIZE EVOLUTION AND RELATION TO DEMOGRAPHY
Damouth's law - relationship between size and abundance of organisms. 
* Larger, have fewer individuals at carrying capacity/equilibirum - eg many mice or one elephant in same area to do with resources they require. -0.75 exponent (size vs abundance)
* Hatton - predator-prey power law - biomass scaling exponent 0.75 keeps popping up when considering patterns in demography and size
* Metabolic scaling B = 0.75

Among species demography scaling is congruent with predictions based on metabolic scaling
* How demography should scale to size based on metabolism i.e. resources organism uses driven by metabolic rate and size which in turn determines demographic rate intrinsic rate of increase, unit 1/t, `$M^B/M$` (ie metabolic rate over your own mass) scales M^(B-1)
* Carrying capacity (p) If fixed amount of energy entering system/population, density of individuals should scale M^-B, energy equivalence rule (pop will use same amount of energy regardless of size) - trade-off of size with number
* Carrying capacity (mass), unit biomass, M^1-B, scales positively with size, because larger organisms have lower mass-specific metabolic rates, expect them to fit more biomass into a system if made up of large individuals versus smaller individuals
* mass productivity (product of these two) M^-1
* mass productivity biovolume M^0
* only difference between bacterium and whales stystematically is size. On average all the other LH variables cancel out. Perfect covariance between size and LH variables which means only meaningful variable difference is size - seems unlikely but is implicit in all these predictions

But how does size affect demography WITHIN species
* get to core of this issue. Not confounding any LH variables which covary with size - just focus on size affect alone.
* not much of a size variation WITHIN a species, across ontogeny you're confounding all sorts of other things too.
* Generated large variations in size in E. coli
* Metabolism scales at ~0.36. E. coli have lower MR at higher densities (shallow gradient)
* Bigger cells have lower mass-specific MR than smaller cells
* can compare scaling of ecological rates with scaling of metabolism

E. coli follow some rules but break others
* Carrying capacity (n) of cells and biomass conform to damuth's law
* higher mass-specific metabolic rates in smaller organisms constrain their biomass  but higher absolute MR in large organisms constrain their density
* but for production and biovolume and intrinsic rate of incraese do not conform by a number of ~1
* larger cells with lower MR and more material to produce seem to reproduce quicker than expected

Artificial selection in phytoplankton
* Algae break most metabolic "rules"
* big cells suffer from self-shading so up-regulated amount of chlorophyll
* strong congruence sometimes in theory of how they should scale and how they actually do
* but when they don't it seems there's something off relative to expectations from AMONG-species comparisons. Mechanistic theory says they should absolutely be constrained by the amount of energy available

Size affects demography, but not in the way theory predicts within species
* We're not just observing noise - size strongly affects all the parameters we are observing - productivity and size, R^2 high, demography and size R^2 is high.
* But size and demography are not connected in the way metabolism would predict
* Classic view: Size -> Metabolic energy -> Demography
* Malerba & Marshall findings: size -> metabolic energy AND demography, metabolic energy <-> demography
* classic chain of causality probably less rhobust than we thought

We know less than we thought about how production and demography scales with size
* Many of the inference about within-species processes we've made are based on among-species patterns (DUSTIN'S CYCLIC ARGUMENT)
* Our understanding of how demography scales with size within species is extremely limited
* Such an understanding is crucial to prediction and management
* When you remove all the confounding variables, we dont see the same scaling effect
* So we need to understand how size effects demography within species

## Part 2 - Growth

Growth is rapid then slow - von Bertalanffy style growth - works for many organisms
Two distinct schools of thought:
* Physiological/mechanistic
* LH optimisation/phenomenological

Long History of mechanistic arguments for growth trajectories
* Darcy Thompson (1915)
* Putter (1920)
* Von Bertalanffy (1938)
* Based on the supposition that if you don't eat you starve/shrink
* Take this and thenm extend it to how an organism grows

Growth slows because resources become limited
* Broadly, you have energy acquisition and energy loss of log-log plot (rate and size)
* Requirement is isometric with mass
* Assimilation is allometric with mass
* So growth slows down because you become resource limited - you can no longer take in enough resources to actually increase your size relative to the resources you require

Scope for growth declines with size
* scope for production is difference between lines

Modern mechanistic theories of growth retain the core assumption that larger body sizes are less efficient of less able to access necessary resources
* Ontogenetic Growth Model [OGM] (West et al, 2001)
* Dynamic Energy Budget [DEB] (Koojiman, 2001)
* Pauly's Limiting Gill Surface Model [LGSM] (Pauly, 2010)
* Also: Reiss, Charnov, Roff
* NB-Luke: So does this mean that if the aquisition and loss lines are parallel then that's an indeterminately growing organism

According to mechanistic theories of growth: small is fast and good
* Things grow fast when they are young and small because they can - tremendous scope to this
* Things grow slowly or not at all when they are large and old because they must - constrained by energy
* Important consequences for how we manage biological systems (more on this later)

Meanwhile in LH land
* Assumed limited resources and reproduction is costly, growth slows when reproduction starts - diversion of energy
* Why grow? You're delaying reproduction and allocating to growth - risky. Effectively saying, I'm not going to use any of the resources I've acquired to reproduce, I bet I can make it to tomorrow/next year to reproduce
* Pay-off you need to get in delaying reproduction is weighted against your risk of mortality - so if there's a 50/50 chance of living next year, you need to have more than double the reproductive return of delaying that time
* Larger sizes yield higher reproductive outputs - good - fitness
* Mortality risk shapes growth trajectories & reproductive schedules - if you have a higher chance of dying, you're more likely to reproduce and not grow to large size
* Gadgil & Bossert (1970)
* Jan Kozlowski et al, 1980s and 90s
* Day & Taylor (1997)
* These models do a good job of predicting the size declines that we've seen
* Models of growth but entirely focused on mortality and reproduction - do a good job of fitting to the data

Mechanistic theories of growth & reproduction
* Most mechanistic theories of growth have long recognised the reproduction is costly
* Problem is if you already have growth declining with size as a result of a limitation hard-wired into the model, it's difficult to add in reproduction at maturity. You've already got a declining energy balance
* Including reproduction is tricky

So how do these mechanistic theories incorporate reproduction?
* Basically increase slope of energy loss line
* Allocation starts at birth
* Constant fraction of body size allocated to reproduction throughout life
* Incorporating reproduction halfway through life cause fish to shrink because you're into negative energy balance territory
* Kearney 2019 argues that DEB includes allocation to reproduction from puberty not birth - however there IS alloaction to the dissipative process of maturation prior to this - so mathematically identical

View of reproductive scaling differs systematically among growth model types
* Mechanistic models tend to *assume* reproduction is *isometric* with size
* LH models tend to *predict* reproduction is *hyperallometric* with size

How does reproduction scale with size? Estimating fish reproduction
* Fish body size and reproductive output
* 10,029 data points across 342 species across 15 orders of marine fishes worldwide
* No. eggs x size x energy density = total output
* 95% species show hyperallometric scaling

Thing we didn't do was no. spawning events.
* Total Fecundity = Batch fecundity x Spawning Frequency
* Now looking at spawning events and size
* Models explicitly specify reproduction per unit time
* If big fish produce more eggs and spawn more often, we've Barneche et al. actually *under*estimated scaling exponent
* But if little fish spawn more often, this could off-set the fewer eggs they produce and so may have *over*estimated exponent and it could be isometric
* Much harder to measure absolute fecundity

Including spawning frequency exacerbates hyperallometric scaling
* Generally for 26 species (5 families), both Batch Fecundinty (eggs per bout) and Spawning Frequency (how often they spawn) scales hyperallometrically
* In the cases where these were already hyperallometric (in terms of reproductive-energy output), the scaling actually exacerbates the exponent
* looks like larger individuals are leveraging their extra resources for reproduction and more frequent spawning

So big fish reproduce more, why does this matter?
* Contradicts the extant and dominant mechanistic theories of growth
* When you fit simple function with increasing allocation to reproduction but assume no limitation (ie keep lines parallel), you recover von Bertalanffy growth very well
* The slowing cessation of growth is most parsimoniously explained by an incraesed allocation to reproduction
* 'Fit' of gorwth models does not mean they capture the underlying dynamics well - two non-linear things coming together do a good job of predicting another non-linear thing hence why the models all fit

Or maybe everything is fine
* Reproductive hyperallometry does not challenge mechanistic growth models (Kearney, M.)
* "If individuals experience consistent ontogenetic changes in diet, then this may well lead to a range of different scaling patterns of 'body mass' and egg energy content with reproduction"
* He's arguing that if larger individuals can access systematically higher quality food (or some kind of efficiency of larger individuals in how they draw down resources), you can recover reproductive models of scaling under models of DEB
* Dustin thinks just because you tweak the model and shove more parameters in doesn't mean it captures the core dynamics well

Reproductive hyperallometry and management
* Fisheries management is remarkably unchanged since the 1950s - couldn't tackle Non-Linear model by hand
* Managers assume isometry
* Biomass is interchangeable
* Size structure is irrelevant
* You just need to know how much spawning biomass is out there and you'll know the number of eggs being produced

Worse, some models are based on mechanistic models of growth - smaller fish are more productive
* "Note that larger species have smaller specific  reproductive output, in accordance with observations" Anderson et al.
* Fisheries scientists are using models which show that we should make fish smaller because they are more productive
* Actually 1 x 30kg = 36 x 2kg fish

Fishing mortality results in fewer large fish
* Even if you're not targetting larger individuals, they still reduce
* If we're taking out the most valuable fish, we could be in trouble, and could explain why our fisheries management is not going well
* Peak for marine-sourced protein was 1986 (wild caught), we can't get anuthing more out of it
* Population growth may not be increasing so much but prosperity is, diets are shifting as prosperity rises - in the West we eat approx. 30kg fish per capita
* If we meet this new demand using beef, we'll need another S America and the water of lake Baikal
* If by fish, we need to do it more efficiently and fish > beef. We have kept up using aquaculture but this secretly relies on wild caught fish
* We've moved from E Africa to W Africa and now hammering it hard
* But we have nowhere left to go

Do larger mothers matter for fisheries?
* Ken Anderson: Limited impact of big fish mothers for population replenishment - no real impact of assuming isometry

The consequences of wrongly assuming isometry for fisheries management
* Fisheries stock are often managed using **S**pawning **P**otential **R**atios 
* SPR = TEP_fished : TEP_virgin
* Idea here is assuming density dependence, if you take stock down to 30% it should bounce back fine - in terms of total production of eggs
* A management 'red line' might be SPR(30)
* Question is what happens if you assume isometry?

Calculated SPR an Fishing mortality
* Turns out if we assume isometry, 0.3 SPR takes us to 1.8 Fishing mortality
* But under hyperallometry, a 1.8 Fishing mortality is actually equal to 0.19 SPR, so we are actually massively overfishing beyong 30% limit inadvertently
* We can then calculate what we *should* be at for SPR and calculate the overharvest ratio F_iso:F_hyper = 1.58
* So we need to reduce catch by around 1/3 just to get back to where we thought we were

Comparing SPRs under reproductive isometry and hyperallometry (Overharvest ratio vs Scaling exponent)
* 33 fisheries accounting for 1/3 world catch, all are over the appropriate line (overharvest ration of 1)
* Assuming isometry systematically overestimates SPR by ~67%
* Fishing mortality rates are ~2.4x too high on average
 
This is bad news
* 1 in 5 people get most of their protein from the sea
* We'd need to reduce global average catch by 1/3 - we'd all die if we did that instantly

How do we create resevoirs of larger fish?
* MPAs make fish slightly bigger
* Global meta-analysis 28% longer
* Fisheries scientists don't like MPAs
* Hasting and Botsford "Equivalence in Yield from Marine Reserves and Traditional Fisheries Management" - argued we should use MPAs to manage fisheries
* Sneaky because equivalence in yield was in number - not biomass

Concerns about MPAs as fisheries management tools
* They might not enhance replenishment
* They shift exploitation to elsewhere
* They carry no additional benefit beyond what good management would already provide

Considerations of MPAs have only been made under assumptions of isometry

Size differences: Length to weight
* 28% longer in MPAs
* Not much but because mass scales ^3, fish are 109% more massive
* Run this through hyperallometry and you find that an average fish inside an MPA has 139% more babies than outside MPA

Jensen's inequality and hyperallometry
* Calculating output based on average with a given distribution
* So actually 175% more babies inside MPA on average

Ratio of egg production per unit area
* After accounting for differences in density inside MPA, effective number of eggs per unit area, in some instances 1 acre of MPA = 224 acres of fished area
* We've been overestimating the efficacy of fish management and under estimating the efficacy of MPA management

Applying MPAs to the world's fisheries
* When we apply straight yield maximisation of fish biomass to world fisheries (relative yield = MPA/effort approach)
* For species with slow life histories, you get almost twice the yield using an MPA approach - long-lived old fish are producing huge amounts of babies and replenishing population really well
* MPA assumptions: each fish has own forcefield, enter common pool as babies and get allocated efficiently to all spaces - patently not tre but as first pass it means we've been underestimating efficacy of MPA
* With MPA strategy, we don't have to cut our global catch by so much

What's next?
* Pattern: Compiling reproductive scaling data for all ectotherms (n ~ 84,000 so far)
* Process: Revisiting the core assumptions about size, demography and production
