Marshall & White paper didnt present a new model

Assumption is that resource supply is met
metabolic energy is dedicated to growth + maintenance
growth rate scales with mass

samraat's dimensionality paper - work in later as reason for superlinear scaling
    intake rate also scaling superlinearly 
read response to Samraat's paper
diego thinks we should leave maintenance as 0.75 exp
don't know what happens at onset of reproductive allocation

suspicion is that we are underestimating contribution of respiration/movement
locomotion + intake is examined under different field to Metabolic theory

in MT use 0.75 for maintenance scaling
read samraat's activity budget paper

optimisation model
fix certain quantities, reproductive allocation could be parameter itself or validation of the model - stochastic nature of the environment
extra energy to reproduction - can I link those?
maintenance rather than use
can you account for locomotion novelty of FMR how much?
maybe you'll see certain classes
how to best classify intake

Phases of supply: 1) resource supply + scaling 2) varying resource supply
foraging scales the same
in a stochastic environment you can use the geometric mean 

goal: expand charnov OGM to include intake rate
fix intake rate and see if life history changes

implicit assumption is that resources are not limited implicitly ie. supply up, resource intake up

consider resource supply as constraint, reproductive allocation vs growth

optimising movement is much harder than optimising how you allocate energy
