## Phenomenological or Mechanistic?
-----
Notes from **White, C. R., & Marshall, D. J. (2019). Should We Care If Models Are Phenomenological or Mechanistic? *Trends in Ecology and Evolution*, 34(4), 276â€“278**
* Mechnistic only good insofar that you can test their predictions on real empiral data
    * But for MTE and DEB you need data to estimate parameter values
* West *et al.* do **not** imply that mature or asymptotic size determined simply by resource supply - allows for mature body size set by evolution (natural selection)
* Milestones in growth modelling e.g. vB 2/3 because of surface area-volume scaling
