    "# Ontogenetic Growth Model\n",
    "Here I simulate growth according to a biphasic ontogenetic growth model, in order to find optimal reproductive parameters - the proportion of body mass devoted, and the mass-scaling (allometric) exponent. This model consists of differential equations describing growth under two distinct ontogenetic phases. Firstly, a juvenile phase, where age is less than age-at-maturity, or $t < \\alpha$ and mass is less than mass-at-maturity, or $m < m_{\\alpha}$. Under this regime, energy for growth is lost only to cellular maintenance, with no diversion to reproduction. Post-maturity, individuals then lose energy to reproduction as well, at a magnitude of c, and which scales with body mass to the exponent $\\rho$.\n",

    "# Optimising Life History\n",
    "In order to determine \"optimal\" reproduction parameters, we need a quantity to be maximised. The fitness ($R_0$) of an individual growing according to the model above can be obtained by integrating the product of an individual's lifetime  reproductive output ($cm^{\\rho}$) and a mortality rate, or $\\mathbb{P}$(survival). How many offspring an inidivudal produces across its lifetime (mature phase, $t > \\geq \\alpha$) is a commonly used measure for fitness. The reason we take this product is because at any time $t$ the realised offspring produced by individual is equivalent to the instantaneous allocation, multiplied by the individual's probability of being alive at time $t$.\n",

    "# Simulation Proper\n",
    "Here I loop through different mortality rates set by $\\kappa$ (```k_vec```) and different scaling exponents for energy intake rate set by $\\beta$ (```a_b_vec```). Within each $\\kappa - \\beta$ combination I then simulate growth trajectories across a large range of $c-\\rho$ combinations. At this point it is useful to review the anatomy of the growth model and go \"under-the-hood\" of the ODE solver. Reproduction kicks in at maturity ($t = \\alpha$), but the amount of energy allocated to reproduction  scales with mass ($cm^{\\rho}$), therefore the larger an individual grows pre-maturity, the larger the \"drop\" in overall size when maturity kicks in.<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical integrators (ODE solvers) work by taking a small step out from an initial starting value and a series of small steps thereafter. If the drop in growth caused by the onset of reproduction is larger than the mass at $t_{\\alpha} - 1$, mass drops to below zero, which breaks the solver. To this point, if this drop occurs in any form, whether mass drops to below zero or not, this implies that the individual subject to this growth curve experiences shrinking at maturity, which is, of course, biologically impossible - no individual has been observed to shed mass in order to become fecund. An individual will shrink if the terminal size is too _______________ Therefore, I took measures to omit shrinking trajectories from the simulation due to biologically infeasibility. Of the remaining feasible trajectories, the optimal $c-\\rho$ combination is that which maximises $R_0$ (third dimension in a heatmap). <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this paper is to show whether there is theoretical scope for hyperallometric fecundity mass-scaling to evolve. Given that evolution seeks to maximise fitness ($R_0$), this scaling ocurrs when $\\rho > 1$. If the $c-\\rho$ combination which maximises $R_0$ for a given $\\alpha$ and species (different terminal sizes) satistfies this condition, then I have shown that the theoretical model presented etc etc"
